The scripts in this directory are used for the Gini analyses for Figures ***

There are three files: 

Gini_utils.R - has all the functions for loading libraries and the final wrapper script for the analyses

extractGini.R - performs the analyses and outputs a .tsv of the Gini values

plotGini.R - reads in the Gini .tsv file to make plots and runs simulations for example distributions 
to create plots for them to.

Of note when these scripts were run the folder structure looked like below:
